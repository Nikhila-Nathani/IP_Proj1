There are 2 ways to run the program
Before you run the program, make sure you have folders:
		final_server_lib, final_client_lib,P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and latest_rfc
1) Import "complete_project.jar" to Eclipse IDE and run from there

2) use runnable jars: final_client.jar and final_server.jar 
	a) We need to run the server first using command: java -jar final_server.jar
	b) Run different clients using the command: java -jar final_client.jar n
	   Where n can take any value between 0 and 5
